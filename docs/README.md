# Personalised Anime List (PAL)
a anime browser and tracker made in the mern stack.  
based off of mal (my anime list) and uses the [jikan.moe](https://jikan.moe) 
api to provide functionality.  

i made this primarily as a exploratory project but also for personal
purposes, as this is an app i would very much use myself.
